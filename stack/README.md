# Stack



It's a linear data structure where insertion/deletion happens only on the top, it enforces Last-in first-out ordering.

Internally it's implemented as a linked list or an array.



# Why Stack?



It restricts access to enforce correctness as it allows for insertion/deletion at top only.

It is used in problems like:

Undo/redo

Function calls \& recursion

Expression evaluation

Backtracking

Reversing data



# Applications



Call stack

Undo/Redo

Browser Navigation

Backtracking Algorithms



# Operations' Time Complexity



|Operation|Time complexity|
|-|-|
|Insertion/Deletion at top|O(1)|
|Access|O(n)|
