# Deque



It's a linear data structure that allows insertions and deletions at both ends.



# Why Deque?



No restrictions like stack and queue.



# Applications



OS Task scheduling

Web browsers: forward/backward history stacks

Algorithms: Sliding window



# Operations' Time Complexity



|Operation|Time complexity|
|-|-|
|Delete at both ends|O(1)|
|Insert at both ends|O(1) amortized for arrays and O(1) for linked lists|
|Update|O(n)|
